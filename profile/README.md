## About 💡

DevRel Jam is a meetup specifically designed for Developer Relations (DevRel) professionals. Our aim is to move beyond typical DevRel discussions and delve into the core technologies that DevRels work with and advocate for. We believe in learning through practical demonstrations and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.

- **Unique Format:** Every DevRel Jam features lightning talks with pairs of speakers focusing on how different technologies integrate or work together.
- **Meaningful Networking:** Ample time for networking to foster connections and learning among peers.

This GitHub organization is the central hub for the DevRel Jam community, hosting information about past and upcoming meetups, including agendas, speaker details, and resources.

## How to Get Involved ⭐️

- **Attend Jams:** Check [this Luma calendar](https://lu.ma/devreljam) for upcoming Jams and RSVP.
- **Speak at Jams:** Share your favorite technology and its cool use cases. We are looking for speakers to present 15-minute lightning talks. Each talk will feature two speakers focusing on core technologies and showcasing how they integrate or work together.
- **Contribute:** Help us improve by contributing to our GitHub repositories.
