## Welcome to DevRelJam 🎉

![Cover](/assets/DevRelJam%20Cover.png)

DevRelJam is a meetup specifically designed for Developer Relations (DevRel) professionals.

Our aim is to move beyond typical DevRel discussions and delve into the core technologies that DevRels work with and advocate for. Every DevRelJam features "duo presentations" by speakers focusing on latest technologies and how they integrate with each other.

This GitHub organization is the central hub for DevRelJams, hosting information about past and upcoming Jams.

Share your favorite technology and its cool use cases in 7.5 minutes at future Jams! [More information here](https://github.com/DevRelJam/Speakers).
